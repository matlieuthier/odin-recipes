    <h2>Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <span>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,<br>
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
    </span>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul> 
    <h3>Steps</h3> 
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Cook the meat: </strong> Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly.<br>
             Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products,<br>
             half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
        </li>
        
        <li> <strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
        
        <li> <strong>Make the cheese layer: </strong> Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley,<br>
             the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Assemble the lasagna: </strong> Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce <br>
             and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Bake the lasagna: </strong> Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. <br>
             Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.
        </li>
    </ol>
